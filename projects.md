  {{ "My Ph.D. [dissertation](https:\\clintonparker.github.io/assets/Thesis.pdf) provides a comprehensive description of several aspects of the Shughni language (Eastern Iranian; Afghanistan and Tajikistan), from phonetics, phonology, and orthography, to nominal and verbal morphology, morphosyntactic alignment, clausal typology, information structure, and clause-level word order.  This dissertation is the outcome of seven years of fieldwork with many native speakers of Shughni, to whom I am eternally grateful for their unwavering support and friendship." | markdownify }}

  {{ "When it comes to language learning, I admit that I may be a typical linguist in speaking several languages poorly. But there are some languages where I can hold my own. And in any case, I truly enjoy the process of learning a language and the intellectual and personal growth it demands. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tNsOxLkBHw) is a video of me speaking a few of the languages that I embarrass myself the least in." | markdownify }}
