  {{ "## Dissertation" | markdownify }}
  
  {{ "My Ph.D. [dissertation](https://clintonparker.github.io/assets/Thesis.pdf) provides a comprehensive description of several aspects of the Shughni language (Eastern Iranian; Afghanistan and Tajikistan), from phonetics, phonology, and orthography, to nominal and verbal morphology, morphosyntactic alignment, clausal typology, information structure, and clause-level word order.  This dissertation is the outcome of seven years of fieldwork with many native speakers of Shughni, to whom I am eternally grateful for their unwavering support and friendship." | markdownify }}

    {{ "## Vestigial ergativity in Shughni" | markdownify }}

  {{ "A significant portion of my research in linguistics has focused on the syntax of Shughni, including vestigial ergativity. In a 2020 [paper](https://clintonparker.github.io/assets/Glossa.pdf) in _Glossa_, I linked this phenomenon to the nature of the second-position clitics which exhibit agreement with subjects in the past tense. While Iâ€™m still interested in morphosyntactic alignment, my work has currently shifted toward language documentation and experimental approaches to exploring grammatical gender in the Pamir languages." | markdownify }}
