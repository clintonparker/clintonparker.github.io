I'm an assistant professor in the [Department of Language, Linguistics, and Literature](http://ssh.nu.edu.kz/lll_about) at Nazarbayev University.  My research focuses on the documentation and description of under-described languages, especially the Pamir languages of Afghanistan and Tajikistan.  I am also interested in experimental approaches to theoretical aspects of language, including syntax, morphology, prosody, and their interfaces.  I received my Ph.D. in Linguistics from McGill University in 2023 with a dissertation titled _A Grammar of the Shughni Language_.
