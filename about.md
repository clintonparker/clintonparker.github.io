  #About me 
  
I am a native of Kentucky, where I grew up doing your stereotypical Kentucky things: roaming around fields of bluegrass, riding horses from time to time, attaching unreasonable emotion to the outcome of basketball games, and, most importantly, eating fried chicken. 

Somewhere along the way, I got interested in languages, and this has shaped and continues to shape a lot of what I do today.  I do linguistics, but I also learn languages.  (These are different things, as it turns out.)
