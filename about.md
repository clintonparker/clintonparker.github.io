  {{ "Somewhere along the way, I got interested in languages, and this has shaped and continues to shape a lot of what I do today. I do linguistics, but I also learn languages. (These are different things, as it turns out.)" | markdownify }}

  {{ "In linguistics, I most enjoy working with speakers of minority and understudied languages, looking at nuances in a language’s grammar which tend to go unnoticed. I’m also concerned with understanding the role of linguists – who often, like me, are outsiders in the communities where they work – in documenting, reclaiming, and/or revitalizing minority languages." | markdownify }}

  {{ "When it comes to language learning, I admit that I may be a typical linguist in speaking several languages poorly. But there are some languages where I can hold my own. And in any case, I truly enjoy the process of learning a language and the intellectual and personal growth it demands. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tNsOxLkBHw) is a video of me speaking a few of the languages that I embarrass myself the least in." | markdownify }}
