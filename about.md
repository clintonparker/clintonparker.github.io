  {{ "# About me" | markdownify }}

  {{ "I am a native of Kentucky, where I grew up doing your stereotypical Kentucky things: roaming around fields of bluegrass, riding horses from time to time, attaching unreasonable emotion to the outcome of basketball games, and, most importantly, eating fried chicken." | markdownify }}

  {{ "Somewhere along the way, I got interested in languages, and this has shaped and continues to shape a lot of what I do today. I do linguistics, but I also learn languages. (These are different things, as it turns out.)" | markdownify }}

  {{ "In linguistics, I most enjoy working with speakers of minority and understudied languages, looking at nuances in a language’s grammar which tend to go unnoticed.  I’m also concerned with understanding the role of linguists – who often, like me, are outsiders in the communities where they work – in documenting, reclaiming, and/or revitalizing minority languages." | markdownify }}
